# Apparel-Image-Detection
This project demonstrates how to build and train a simple neural network using Keras (TensorFlow backend) to classify images from the Fashion MNIST dataset. The dataset consists of grayscale 28x28 pixel images of 10 fashion categories.

# 👕 Fashion MNIST Apparel Classification using Neural Networks

This project demonstrates how to classify images of fashion apparel using a simple deep learning model built with Keras and TensorFlow. The model is trained on the Fashion MNIST dataset to recognize 10 different types of clothing items.

## 📁 Dataset

We use the **Fashion MNIST** dataset which contains:

- 60,000 training images
- 10,000 test images
- Grayscale 28x28 pixel images
- 10 fashion categories

Flatten Layer: Converts 2D image (28x28) into 1D (784).

Dense Layer: Fully connected layers.

ReLU Activation: For hidden layer non-linearity.

Softmax Activation: For multi-class classification.
